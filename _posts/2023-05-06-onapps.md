Haven't worked on any large personal projects in a long while now. I hope to change that. Starting today. I still code using *vi*, without any plugins, and I think that makes me slow compared to programmers who use Copilot or ChatGPT. But I love programming, and I prefer to write my own code. I'm a simple man. I don't use Stockfish when I'm playing chess, and I don't use Copilot while coding.
