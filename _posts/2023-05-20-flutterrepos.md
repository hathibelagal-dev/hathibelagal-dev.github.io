Finally found the time to update three of my old Flutter packages. They support Dart 3 now, and have null safety. Hoping they will be more useful now.

- [Path Morph](https://pub.dev/packages/path_morph)
- [Text to Path Maker](https://pub.dev/packages/text_to_path_maker)
- [LEB128](https://pub.dev/packages/leb128)

Of course, they're open source and you can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/hathibelagal-dev).
