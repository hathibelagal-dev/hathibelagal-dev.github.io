title: "Experimental Russian Learning"

So, I wanted to know how much of a new language a polyglot could learn by just starting from a random sentence.

The sentence I chose was: Без тебя мне холодно

It's Russian, and it means "Without you, I feel cold."

Now, **without** is a common preposition. In Russian, it always takes the genitive case. So, the Russian ты (you) becomes тебя. That's interesting. I had to find more examples, just so I can master the pattern. Using my local LLaMA, I got these:

- Без проблем : Without problem, or no problem! That's a handy phrase to know.
- Без смысла : Without meaning, or pointless. Hopefully this exercise won't be pointless.
- Без конца : Without end, or endless. I think I'm getting a hang of it at this point.
- Без воды : Without water. Apparently this can also be a phrase that figuratively means something is "concise" or "to the point"... something stripped down to its essentials. By the way, while "Без воды" and "doesn't hold water" don't share a direct linguistic connection (as far as we know), they both seem to leverage the common understanding and symbolism of water. They, of course, convey two totally distinct ideas too.
- Без сахара : Without sugar. Figuratively, it might be used to describe something that lacks appeal.
- Без соли : Without salt. Again, figuratively, it can be used to say that something lacks flavor or excitement, similar to saying something is "bland" or "uninteresting".

Now, I've added quite a few words to my vocabulary. But they are all in the genitive case. воды, for instance, is the genitive form. Time to learn their nominative forms.

So, water in the nominative form is вода. That reminds me of vodka. What does that mean? Well, водка clearly has some connection to вода. It could mean "little water" because -ка is the dimunitive suffix. The use of diminutives in Slavic languages is very common.

But водка also means "water of life". Hmm, I'm a student of Latin, and that reminds me of *aqua vitae* (Aquavit). In Gaelic, there's a similar term: "uisge beatha" (whiskey)...
