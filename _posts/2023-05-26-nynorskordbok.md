I have always wanted to make a Nynorsk dictionary, and this week, I was able to create one. It was a fun experience working with React Native, Redux, React Native Paper, React Navigation, and RTK Query. The API exposed by UiB and Språkrådet is easy to use and very informative. If you're a fan of Nynorsk and Ivar Aasen, then you need to be using my Nynorskordbok.
